    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Test Azure Functions directly using the client\n",
    "2. ✅ Create a tool definition for the health check function\n",
    "3. ✅ Register tools with the Foundry agent\n",
    "4. ✅ Let the agent automatically call tools based on user queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: Describes what the tool does and its parameters\n",
    "- **Tool Handler**: Function that actually executes when the tool is called\n",
    "- **Function Calling**: The agent decides when to use tools based on the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue to **Lab 3: Quote Function Tool** to add another function and see how agents handle multiple tools."
